# sample-mob

Playing around with WebAudio and mobile interactions. I'm taking inspiration from the very fun [Teenage Engineering PO-33](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-33) and other weird things ([Wicki-Hayden Keyboard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki-Hayden_note_layout)). I'll push demo builds to [https://awwaiid.github.io/sample-mob-web/](https://awwaiid.github.io/sample-mob-web/).

## Ideas

* Sample directly from mic/input on device
* Build simple sequences (step sequencer)
* Looper (maybe quantized to step-sequencer)
* Visualize and trim waveforms

## Development
```bash
# Initial setup
yarn install

# Compiles and hot-reloads for development
yarn serve

# Compiles and minifies for production
yarn build

# Lints and fixes files
yarn lint
```
